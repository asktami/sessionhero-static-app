				"In this session, we'll cover topics that relate well to the manufacturing/warehouse space. First, two approaches to inventory; one easy-to-implement solution with unstored calcs, and a more complex solution using static fields with scripted amount updates. Next, we'll go over the creation of labels for the warehouse and how we've used automation to save a LOT of time, including taking a 60 or 90 minute process per shipment down to 30 to 60 seconds. Optionally, as time permits in the session, we will cover some of the practicalities of using FileMaker in a warehouse space.",
